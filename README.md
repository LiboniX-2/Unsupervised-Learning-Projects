# 🧩 Unsupervised Learning Projects

A collection of **unsupervised machine learning** projects focused on uncovering hidden patterns, structures, and relationships within data — without labeled outputs.
This repository demonstrates applications of **clustering**, **dimensionality reduction**, and **feature extraction** techniques using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib**.
